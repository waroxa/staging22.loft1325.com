Prompt: Create 3 distinct mobile homepage templates for Loft 1325 (a self-serve virtual hotel) using the same structure as a mobile hotel landing page: sticky top bar → hero image slider → booking card with dates + guests → trust/review section → feature highlights → room preview → final CTA. Use the same button colors as the current brand (#003B95 primary, #FDB913 accent). The audience is an affluent, social-media-forward group of women who want “wow” moments. Include copy that emphasizes: self check-in, digital keys, instant bill payments, and split payments. Show sentiment analysis of the customer feedback first (analyze tone and pain points: “not wow,” “feels dead,” “friends are rich,” “needs to impress,” “wants to shop/browse rooms”), then translate the insights into design decisions. Deliver three HTML + CSS variants optimized for mobile (390-430px wide) with glamorous, high-end vibes. Keep all text in English with optional French sublines. Include clearly marked placeholders for hero slider images and room images.
